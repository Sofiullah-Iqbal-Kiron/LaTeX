\index{Bubble sort definition} Bubble sort is a very simple sorting algorithm who sort elements by just swapping two adjacent element is they are not in the correct order. Bubble sort has $O(n^2)$ as it's worst-case and average-case time complexity. Here is the algorithm of bubble sort:

\KwData{An array of N elements.}
\KwResult{Sorted list.}
\Begin

$\textrm{Declare \& initialize variable i=0, j=0 and n}=\textrm{length(array)}$.\;
Set boolean swapped to false.\;
\For{i from 0 to n-1, increment by 1}

		\If{array$[j]$ is greater than array$[j+1]$}
		{
			Swap(array$[j]$, array$[j+1]$)\;
			Set swapped value to true.
		}

	\If{not swapped}{exit from the loop.}
	\Else{Set swapped value to false again.}

Sorting the array [15, 18, 4, 5, 2] using bubble sort:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item After iteration 1: [15, 18, 4, 5, 2]
	\item After iteration 2: [15, 4, 18, 5, 2]
	\item After iteration 3: [15, 4, 5, 18, 2]
	\item After iteration 4: [15, 4, 5, 2, 18]
	\item After iteration 5: [4, 15, 5, 2, 18]
	\item After iteration 6: [4, 5, 15, 2, 18]
	\item After iteration 7: [4, 5, 2, 15, 18]
	\item After iteration 8: [4, 5, 2, 15, 18]
	\item After iteration 9: [4, 5, 2, 15, 18]
	\item After iteration 10: [4, 2, 5, 15, 18]
	\item After iteration 11: [4, 2, 5, 15, 18]
