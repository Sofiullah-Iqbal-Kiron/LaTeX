\begin{enumerate}
	\item Determine the equation of the curve $2x^2+3y^2-8x+6y-7=0$ when then origin is transferred to the point $(2, -1)$
	\item Determine the equation of the parabola $x^2-2xy+y^2+2x-4y+3=0$ after rotating of axes through $45$ degree.
	\item The direction cosine of axes remaining the same, choose a new origin such that the new co-ordinates of the pair of points whose old co-ordinate are $(5, -13)$ and $(-3, 11)$ whose new co-ordinates are $(h, k)$ and $(-h, -k)$.
	\item Transform to parallel axes through the new origin of the equations.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Origin $(1, -2), 2x^2+y^2-4x+4y=0$
			\item Origin $(3, 1), x^2-6x+2y^2+7=0$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Transform to axes inclined at 45 degree to the original axes the equations.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $x^2-y^2=a^2$
			\item $x^2-y^2-2\sqrt{2}x-10\sqrt{2}y+2=0$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Remove the first degree terms in each of the following equations.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $3x^2-4y^2-6x-8y-10=0$
			\item $2x^2+5y^2-12x+10y-7=0$
			\item $3x^2-4y^2+6x+24y-135=0$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Transform the equation $11x^2+24xy+4y^2-20x-40y-5=0$ to rectangular axes through the point (2, -1) and inclined at an angle $\tan^{-1}\frac{4}{3}$.
	\item Determine the angle through which the axes must be rotated to remove the xy term in the equation, $7x^2-6\sqrt{3}xy+13y^2=16$.
	\item The direction of axes remaining the same, choose a new origin such that the new coordinate of the pair of points whose old coordinate are (5, -13) and (-3, 11) may be the forms (h, k) and (-h, -k).
	\item Transform the axes inclined at 30 degree to the original axes the equation, $x^2+2\sqrt{3}xy-y^2=2a^2$.
	\item The equation $3x^2+2xy+3y^2-18x-22y+50=0$ is transformed to $4x^2+2y^2=1$ when referred to rectangular axes through the\\
	point (2, 3). Find the inclination of the latter axes to the former.
