	Here we have to solve the one-dimensional wave equation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Question 1}
	\framesubtitle{Trying to solve}
	Taking the complex Fourier transform of both sides of (1), we have
	\begin{equation}
		\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\delta^2y}{\delta t^2}e^{-iux} dx=c^2\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\delta^2y}{\delta x^2}e^{-iux} dx
	\end{equation}
	By the Fourier transform of the derivative of a function we have if $F^n(x)$ is the nth-derivative of $F(x)$ and the first $(n-1)$ derivatives of F(x) vanish as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$ then $F\{F^n(x)\}=(-iu)^n F\{F(x)\}$. \\
	Thus from (2) we have
	\begin{align*}
		              & \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}ye^{-iux} dx =c^2(-iu)^2F\{y(x,t)\} \\
