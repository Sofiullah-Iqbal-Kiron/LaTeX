Technical publications for Engineer Research and Development Center, US Army
Corps of Engineers follow an elaborate style [1]. This style is accompanied by
templates for a popular word processor software. In this class, commissioned by
US Army Corps of Engineers, we try to recreate this style for LATEX.
There are several kinds of documents described by [1]: Technical Report, Technical Note, Miscellaneous Paper, Contract Report, Letter Report, Monograph,
Special Report, Brochure. In this class we follow the guidelines for Technical Reports (TR). However, it can be used for other kinds of documents as long as they
do not differ much from Technical Reports.
