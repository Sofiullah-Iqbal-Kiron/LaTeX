	\section{Question solve}
	Intellectual Property(abbreviated IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected in law. \\
	The four ($4$) main types of intellectual property are
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[Patent:] is a property right for an investor that is typically granted by a government agency. The patent allows the inventor exclusive rights to invention, which could be a design, process, an improvement or physical invention such as a machine.
		\item [Copyright:] provide authors and creators of original material the exclusive right to use, copy or duplicate their material.
		\item[Trademark:] is a symbol, phrase or insignia that is recognizable and represents a product that legally separates it from other products. A trademark is exclusively assigned to a company, meaning the company owns the trademark so that no others may use or copy it.
		\item [Trade secret:] is a company's process or practice that is not public information, which provides an economic benefit or advantage to the company or holder of the trade secret.

	\textbf{Short notes}\linebreak
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Passing off happens when someone deliberately or unintentionally passes of their goods or services as those belonging to another party. This action of misrepresentation often damages the goodwill of a person or business, causing financial or reputation damage. The elements of passing off is goodwill, misrepresentation and damage.
		\item Digital Signature in cryptography, a digital signature or digital signature scheme is used to pretend the security properties of a signature in digital form. Digital signature schemes normally give two algorithms:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item One for signing which involves the user's public key.
			\item Other for verifying signatures which involves the user's public key.
		\end{enumerate}
		The output of the signature process is called the digital signature. Digital signatures are used to create Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) schemes. User's public key is tied to user by a digital identity certificate issued by a certificate authority.
		\item Deceptive Similarity is an issue of  marks can be defined as similarity between trademarks that can lead the general public of average intelligence to believe that the mark in question is somehow related to a registered or well-known trademark. So, a trademark should not be registered if it is deceptively similar.
		\item Infringement of copyright or copyright violations occur when an authorized party recreates all or a portion of an original work, such as a work of art, music or a novel. The duplicated content need not be an exact replica of the original to qualify as an infringement.
	\end{itemize}
