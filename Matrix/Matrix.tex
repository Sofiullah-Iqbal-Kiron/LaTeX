	\section*{MATRIX ALGEBRA}
		\subsection*{Introduction}
			\textbf{J. J. Sylvester} was the first man who introduced the word \textbf{MATRIX} in $1850$ and later on \textbf{Arthur Cayley} developed the theory of matrices in a symmetric way. Matrix is a powerful tool of modern mathematics which is originated in the study of linear equation and it has wide applications in every branch of science.
		\subsection*{Definition of Matrix}
			A matrix is rectangular array of numbers (Real of Complex) enclosed by a pair of square brackets [ ] / parenthesis ( ) / double vertical rolls $||\hspace{1mm}||$. Or we can say it as a $2D$ array. The numbers in the matrix are called \textbf{entries} or \textbf{elements} of the matrix. That is, a rectangular array of the form:-\footnote{For create this matrix, I uses \textit{amsmath} package.}

			\begin{bmatrix}
				a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n}\\
				a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n}\\
				\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots\\
				\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots\\
				a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn}\\
			\end{bmatrix}
